## Practice exercises

* Clone the template to your machine
* Install the package using the instuctions in the README
* Run the create_publication.py file and confirm that it successfully imports and runs functions from the sub-modules
* Add a new module called <your_name>.py in the utilities module.
* Write a basic function in that module to print your name
* Import that function to the create_publication.py file and run it. It should look something like this
    ```python
        from utilities.connor import print_my_name

        print_my_name(name='Connor')
    ```

Please call for help if you get stuck. Getting these things set up first time can be fiddly so we are happy to help. Once you are up and running, it should be much easier.
